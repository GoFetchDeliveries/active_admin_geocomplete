ActiveAdminCSVImport
=======================

- Add CSV import with one line of code
- Parses the file client-side and imports line-by-line to avoid Heroku timeouts
- Validates the CSV has the correct column names before importing.

Inspired by https://github.com/krhorst/active_admin_importable and makes use of Recline.js. This is a relatively heavy solution with a lot of JS dependencies, but should be easier for large imports on Heroku than first uploading to a file server.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'active_admin_csv_import'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

Add 'csv_importable' into your active admin resource:

```
ActiveAdmin.register Thing do
  csv_importable
end
```

An import button should appear on the resource's index page. All columns are expected other than id, updated_at and created_at.

## Demo

http://active-admin-csv-import.herokuapp.com/admin
```
admin@example.com
password
```

## Use other delimiter than semicolon

In `config/initializers/active_admin.rb`, search `csv_options` and set the csv separator as it's showed in the file.

## Wishlist / TODOS

1. Add Appraisal to test against multiple versions of Rails

## Specs
```
bundle exec rspec spec
```
The test suite is limited, but it's a start.
